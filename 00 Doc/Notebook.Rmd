#**Introduction**
This is our R Notebook used to show how to detailing the 3 Tableau visualizations and a Shiny publication of obesity data in the United States. The dataset was retrieved through data.world and cleaned up using an ETL script that we built. This includes our instructions on how to access the data as well as our process of creating the 3 visualizations and Shiny publication from the data set in question.

#**R Configuration**
Below, we display our sessionInfo().

```{r source}
sessionInfo(package=NULL)
```

#**Data Background**
The data displayed represents the data grabbed from the "Obesity by State in 2014" dataset from Data.world (https://data.world/health/obesity-by-state-2014). The data was originally 2 separate tables containing adult obesity rates and adolescent obesity rates. The two tables were cleaned-up using ETL scripts that we built for this project. Then the 2 tables were merged into 1 using a union. Here is the ETL Script that we created.

```{r}
source("../01 Data/adolescent obesity ETL.R")
```

```{r}
source("../01 Data/adult obesity ETL.R")
```
We also utilized joins to make the visualizations more interesting. We used a state table that divided up the different states into regions (https://data.world/markmarkoh/us-state-table), the US Census data for population (https://data.world/uscensusbureau/acs-2015-5-e-agesex), and Community Health Status Indicator (CHSI) data (https://data.world/health/chsi-to-combat-obesity). The ETL scripts for those data sets are below.

```{r}
source("../01 Data/statetable ETL.R")
```

```{r}
source("../01 Data/population_byage ETL.R")
```

```{r}
source("../01 Data/heartdisease ETL.R")
```

```{r}
source("../01 Data/RiskFactors ETL.R")
```
#**Downloading the Data File**
The cleaned up data file is hosted on Data.World. You can access it by going to this web address: https://data.world/christinalien/s-17-dv-final-project. Next, click the download button in the upper right hand corner of the screen. Download the file into a CSVs folder at the same level as the project folder. The file will download as a compressed (zipped) file containing a .csv file. Unzip the package, rename the csv to PreETL_adultobese.csv and PreETL_adolescentobese.csv and you should have the data file ready to go, just run the ETL.r script and it should clean up the data. Next, the cleaned up data was uploaded back into data.world and, using the query editor, we created a new column 'Age' that displayed Adult for the adult data and Adolescent for the adolescent data. Then, we combined the two tables using a union, downloaded the results to a csv, and uploaded the final result of the table as "Adult_Adolescent_Obesity.csv".

Thanks for showing an interest in our work, we hope you enjoyed the ways we decided to visualize obesity data throughout different slices of the United States.
